## What is a fossorial animal? 

A fossorial animal is one adapted to digging which lives primarily but not solely, underground. Some examples are badgers, naked mole-rats, clams, meerkats, and mole salamanders, as well as many beetles, wasps, and bees. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossorial)

All of our fossorial animal names come from the good people at [animalia.bio](https://animalia.bio). They kindly donated their curated list of [fossorial animals](https://animalia.bio/fossorial-animals) found on their website and provided permission to use their images. 

Thanks again to Ivan and the team there!
